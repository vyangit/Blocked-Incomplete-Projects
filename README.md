# Blocked Incomplete Projects

## What is this repo?
This repo is an archive of personal MVPs/projects with interesting ideas that were midway in progress, but were blocked due to a design or system restrictions. This repo is mainly to build an archive of code samples but also provide ideas/code samples for others to bounce off on. 

## What's the blockage in the project?
For each project the blockage(s) is indicated in the repo issue log with the following syntax (replace italic words with description):
* **\[ _PROJECT_NAME_ \]: _DESCRIPTION_**
 
* **\[ _PROJECT_NAME_ \]: REPORT**
  * For more complicated blockages or a list of blockages the following syntax is used as well as tagged as a report:

## Where's the blockage in code?
The blockage in code is labelled with a "**BLOCKAGE:**" comment. For more complicated blockages, issue logs will provide the best information trace information/steps, and "**BLOCKAGE:**" comments maybe be absent or multiple may be used in code.

## _What you can't even debug that simple blockage?_
These projects are mainly learning projects/MVPs made in the span of 1-4 days that I would love to see working but don't see the need to continue at the moment. Therefore, I usually decide to archive them so I don't forget about them and can pick them up again later. 

## Are these projects ever going to be resolved?
If I have done a complete redesign/reimplementation of the application to resolve the issue, I will indicate it on the application directory and issue log report with a **[RESOLVED]** tag. In addition, a link will be provided to the completed application/project.

## I saw/have another application that does exactly this, want the link?
Yes! Projects will be labelled **[RESOLVED]** and the corresponding link will be added to the issue log report to close the issue.
